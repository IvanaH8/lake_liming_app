After 16 hours, the concentration of Ca in the columns is determined at different depths using ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry). Six measurements are taken from each column (every 40 cm from the surface down to 2 m).

This is done by numerically integrating the concentration-depth relationship. If this relationship was perfectly known for all depths in the column, the total amount of Ca between depths \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) would be given by the integral\n\\[\nM_{Ca} = \\int_{d_1}^{d_2} C(h) \\ dh\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(M_{Ca}\\) is the mass of Ca and \\(C(h)\\) is the function describing the change of concentration of Ca with depth, \\(h\\). In practice, this integral is approximated from the concentrations measured at each depth using either Simpson’s rule or the trapezoidal rule. By default, the application uses the trapezoidal rule.\nThe instantaneous dissolution for each column is calculated as the amount of Ca dissolved after 16 hours (approximated using the integral above), divided by the total amount of Ca in the lime being tested. The percentage of Ca in the original lime is specified by the manufacturer and entered into the template. The total mass of Ca added to each column can therefore be calculated as this percentage multiplied by 0.579 g (the amount of lime initially added to each column).\nThe main output from the instantaneous dissolution test is a characteristic curve showing the dissolution proportion at each pH value. Figure 1 shows an example based on data in Table 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Instantaneous dissolution curve for different values of pH."

Different amounts of lime are then added to each column, corresponding to the following lime concentrations (assuming complete dissolution): 10, 20, 35, 50 and 85 mg/l. The columns are left to equilibrate for 16 hours and the total instantaneous dissolution for each column is determined using the procedure described in {#sec-instant-dissolution}. The overdosing factor is then calculated as the ratio \\(D_{10} / D_{x}\\), where \\(D_10\\) is the instantaneous dissolution for the column where 10 mg/l of lime were initially added, and \\(D_{x}\\) is the instantaneous dissolution for the column where \\(x\\) mg/l of lime were added.\nA typical curve for overdosing factors is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overdosing factors."
