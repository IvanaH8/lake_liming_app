This website provides documentation for the liming application. 

The current pages are just placeholder (in English). The final website should be translated to Norwegian. 

## Overview {#sec-overview}

The application performs two kinds of calculation:

 1. **Summarising data from column tests**. Users can upload column test data using a standard template and calculate characteristic curves for **instantaneous dissolution** and **overdosing factor**.
 
 2. **Lake modelling**. Estimate the amount of lime required to achieve a target change in pH (for specified lime type, lake characteristics and application method).
