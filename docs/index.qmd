This website provides documentation for the liming application. 

The current pages are just placeholders (in English). 

## Overview {#sec-overview}

The application performs two kinds of calculation:

 1. **Summarising data from column tests**. Upload column test data using a standard template and calculate characteristic curves for **instantaneous dissolution** and **overdosing factor**.
 
 2. **Lake modelling**. Estimate the amount of lime required to achieve a target change in pH (depending on the type of lime, lake characteristics and lime application method).
