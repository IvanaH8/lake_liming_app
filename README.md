# Lake liming app

Initial exploration of example data provided by Kar-Jan Erstad (Rådgivende Agronomar AS). This code is expected to form the basis for a more comprehensive web application funded by Miljødirektoratet during 2023.

## Resources

 * **[Column test template](./data/liming_app_data_template_v1-0.xlsx)**. A proposed template for uploading column test data to the app.
 
 * **[Example dataset](./data/liming_app_test_data.xlsx)**. An example dataset from Karl-Jan transferred to the new template.
 
 * **[Initial results](./code/liming.ipynb)**. A notebook reproducing the calculations from Karl-Jan's speadsheet (with minor modifications). The Python code for the calculations is [here](./code/liming.py).
 
 * **[TPKALK](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/handle/11250/208709)**. An old model developed by Atle Hindar et al. at NIVA during the 1990s. This model implements additional calculations required to estimate liming requirements for lakes with specific characteristics.
